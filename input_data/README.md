# Input Data

This includes all data used in the analysis of the impacts of coring on tree mortality. 

The file https://github.com/EcoClimLab/Coring-Mortality/blob/master/input_data/SCBI_SIGEO_all_trees_cored_2010.csv is a list of all trees cored in 2010 and 2011. It includes basic information on the individual cores, the unique tree ID, if the tree was cored more than once, and the exact date of coring.

The file https://github.com/EcoClimLab/Coring-Mortality/blob/master/input_data/SCBI_SIGEO_all_trees_surveyed_2008.csv contains information on all trees cored in the ForestGEO plot at SCBI in 2008. For this study we were most interested in the specific tree ID and date surveyed.

The file https://github.com/EcoClimLab/Coring-Mortality/blob/master/input_data/mortality_survey_2017%2Bcored_2010.csv is a simple combination of the 2017 mortality survey and the list of trees cored in 2010. Directions for its construction are provided in the final script. The only addition is a column for trees cored in 2010 where 1 == cored, and 0 == uncored.
